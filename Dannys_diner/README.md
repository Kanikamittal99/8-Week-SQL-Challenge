### Introduction
- Danny seriously loves Japanese food so at the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
- Danny’s Diner requires our assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from its few months of operation but has no idea how to use its data
to help them run the business.

### Problem Statement
 - Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favorite.
   -   Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.
- He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
